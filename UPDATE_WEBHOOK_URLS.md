# üîß Update GDPR Webhook URLs in Shopify Partners

## üö® CURRENT ISSUE

Your Shopify Partners dashboard shows **WRONG webhook URLs**:

```
‚ùå Customers redact URL: https://shopchatai.indigenservices.com/webhooks
‚ùå Customers data request URL: https://shopchatai.indigenservices.com/webhooks  
‚ùå Shop redact URL: https://shopchatai.indigenservices.com/webhooks
```

**These need to be updated to:**

```
‚úÖ Customers redact URL: https://shopchat-new.indigenservices.com/webhooks
‚úÖ Customers data request URL: https://shopchat-new.indigenservices.com/webhooks
‚úÖ Shop redact URL: https://shopchat-new.indigenservices.com/webhooks
```

## ‚úÖ HOW TO FIX (2 MINUTES)

### Method 1: Update via Shopify Partners Dashboard

1. **Go to Shopify Partners:**
   ```
   https://partners.shopify.com
   ```

2. **Select your app** (ShopChat AI Chatbot)

3. **Go to "Configuration" tab**

4. **Scroll down to "Privacy compliance webhook subscriptions"**

5. **Update each URL:**
   - **Customers redact URL:**
     ```
     https://shopchat-new.indigenservices.com/webhooks
     ```
   
   - **Customers data request URL:**
     ```
     https://shopchat-new.indigenservices.com/webhooks
     ```
   
   - **Shop redact URL:**
     ```
     https://shopchat-new.indigenservices.com/webhooks
     ```

6. **Set API version:**
   ```
   2025-10
   ```

7. **Click "Save"**

### Method 2: Update via Shopify CLI (Faster)

```bash
cd /workspace/ShopChat-New-Final

# Deploy configuration to Partners
shopify app deploy
```

This will automatically sync your `shopify.app.toml` webhooks to Partners.

## üîç VERIFICATION

After updating, verify webhooks are working:

### Test GDPR Data Request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://shopchat-new.indigenservices.com/webhooks/customers/data_request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Topic: customers/data_request" \
  -d '{
    "shop_domain": "test-store.myshopify.com",
    "customer": {
      "id": 123,
      "email": "test@example.com"
    }
  }'
```

**Expected:** Should return 200 OK

### Test Customer Redact:

```bash
curl -X POST https://shopchat-new.indigenservices.com/webhooks/customers/redact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Topic: customers/redact" \
  -d '{
    "shop_domain": "test-store.myshopify.com",
    "customer": {
      "id": 123,
      "email": "test@example.com"
    }
  }'
```

**Expected:** Should return 200 OK

### Test Shop Redact:

```bash
curl -X POST https://shopchat-new.indigenservices.com/webhooks/shop/redact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Topic: shop/redact" \
  -d '{
    "shop_domain": "test-store.myshopify.com",
    "shop_id": 123
  }'
```

**Expected:** Should return 200 OK

## üìã WEBHOOK ENDPOINTS

Your app has these specific GDPR webhook routes:

### 1. Customers Data Request
```
Route: /webhooks/customers/data_request
File: app/routes/webhooks.customers.data_request.tsx
Function: Collects and emails customer data
```

### 2. Customers Redact
```
Route: /webhooks/customers/redact
File: app/routes/webhooks.customers.redact.tsx
Function: Deletes customer chat data
```

### 3. Shop Redact
```
Route: /webhooks/shop/redact
File: app/routes/webhooks.shop.redact.tsx
Function: Deletes all shop data
```

### 4. Generic Webhook Handler
```
Route: /webhooks
File: app/routes/webhooks.tsx
Function: Handles other webhooks (orders, app uninstall, etc.)
```

## üéØ WHY THIS MATTERS

**Without correct webhook URLs:**
- ‚ùå GDPR compliance won't work
- ‚ùå Customer data requests will fail
- ‚ùå Data redaction won't work
- ‚ùå App Store approval may be rejected

**With correct webhook URLs:**
- ‚úÖ GDPR compliant
- ‚úÖ Data requests work automatically
- ‚úÖ Ready for App Store
- ‚úÖ Legal compliance maintained

---

## üîÑ AUTOMATIC WEBHOOK REGISTRATION

Your webhooks are defined in `shopify.app.toml`:

```toml
[webhooks]
api_version = "2025-10"

  [[webhooks.subscriptions]]
  compliance_topics = ["customers/data_request", "customers/redact", "shop/redact"]
  uri = "https://shopchat-new.indigenservices.com/webhooks"
```

**To sync to Partners:**
```bash
shopify app deploy
```
