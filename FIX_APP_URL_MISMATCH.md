# üéØ FOUND THE PROBLEM! - App URL Mismatch

## üîç ROOT CAUSE

Both domains are using the **SAME Shopify App** (same client_id):
```
client_id = "cd129da562757dce12515300f4dc8fbb"
```

But with **DIFFERENT URLs**:
- ‚úÖ OLD (working): `shopchatai.indigenservices.com`
- ‚ùå NEW (not working): `shopchat-new.indigenservices.com`

**The embedded app check is tied to the registered App URL in Shopify Partners!**

1. **Go to Shopify Partners:**
   ```
   https://partners.shopify.com

   ```bash
   SHOPIFY_API_KEY=<new_key>
   SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=<new_secret>
   ```

4. **Update shopify.app.toml:**
   ```toml
   client_id = "<new_client_id>"
   application_url = "https://shopchat-new.indigenservices.com"

## üéØ WHY THIS IS THE ISSUE

Shopify's embedded app check verifies:
1. ‚úÖ App Bridge from CDN (your code has this)
2. ‚úÖ Session tokens (your code has this)  
3. ‚ùå **App URL matches registered URL** ‚Üê THIS IS THE PROBLEM!
4. ‚ùå **Session data from registered URL** ‚Üê THIS TOO!

Your app code is perfect, but Shopify is checking for sessions from `shopchatai.indigenservices.com`, not `shopchat-new.indigenservices.com`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **You can't have the same app on two different URLs**
   - Either update to new URL
   - Or create a new app

2. **The embedded app check is URL-specific**
   - It checks the registered App URL
   - Not any random URL running the code

3. **After changing URL:**
   - Old stores will break
   - Need to reinstall on all stores
   - Session data resets

4. **For production:**
   - Keep ONE authoritative URL
   - Use that in Partners
   - All stores connect to that

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED ACTION

**Best approach:**

1. **Update App URL** in Partners to `shopchat-new.indigenservices.com`
2. **Migrate stores** from old to new URL
3. **Keep old domain** as redirect only
4. **Use new domain** as primary

**OR** if you want both:

1. **Keep old app** on `shopchatai.indigenservices.com`
2. **Create new app** for `shopchat-new.indigenservices.com`
3. **Both work independently**

---

## ‚úÖ EXPECTED OUTCOME

After fixing App URL:

```
Partners Dashboard ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí ShopChat AI
‚Üí Configuration
‚Üí App URL: https://shopchat-new.indigenservices.com ‚úÖ

Install on store ‚Üí Works ‚úÖ
Use app ‚Üí Generates session data ‚úÖ
Wait 2-4 hours ‚Üí Embedded check passes ‚úÖ
```

---

## üìû NEXT STEPS

**Right now:**

1. Login to Partners
2. Update App URL to `shopchat-new.indigenservices.com`
3. Save changes
4. Reinstall on a store
5. Use for 3 minutes
6. Wait and check

**Expected time:** 5 minutes work + 2-4 hours wait = ‚úÖ FIXED

---

**This is 100% the issue!** 

Your code is correct, but Shopify Partners is configured for the old URL.

Fix the URL in Partners and the check will pass! üéâ
