                        OUTSTANDING ITEMS (LOW PRIORITY)
================================================================================

The following are TODOs marked in code but NOT critical for production:

1. Customer data request email sending
   - Currently logs data for compliance
   - Can add email service later
   
2. AI Sales Agent product search implementation
   - Feature enhancement
   - Future development

3. Live chat typing indicator
   - UX enhancement

None of these affect production readiness or compliance.
