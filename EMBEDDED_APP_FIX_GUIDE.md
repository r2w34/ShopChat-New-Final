# 🔧 Embedded App Checks - Complete Fix Guide

**Issue**: "Embedded app checks" showing as failed in Shopify Partners Dashboard

---

## ✅ YOUR APP IS ALREADY CONFIGURED CORRECTLY!

Your code already has:
- ✅ AppProvider with App Bridge
- ✅ Session token authentication
- ✅ Latest API version (January 2025)
- ✅ New embedded auth strategy enabled
- ✅ Proper OAuth implementation

**The issue is**: The automated check needs you to **actually use the app** on a development store to generate session data.

---

## 🎯 SOLUTION: Install & Interact with Your App

### Step 1: Install App on Development Store

1. **Go to Partners Dashboard**
   - https://partners.shopify.com/

2. **Select Your App**
   - Find "ShopChat AI" (or your app name)
   - Click on it

3. **Test on Development Store**
   - Click "Test on development store"
   - Select: `tulipst.myshopify.com`
   - Click "Install app"

4. **Grant Permissions**
   - Review the permissions requested
   - Click "Install app"

---

### Step 2: Interact with the App

Once installed, you MUST interact with the app to generate session data:

1. **Access the App from Shopify Admin**
   ```
   https://tulipst.myshopify.com/admin/apps/your-app-name
   ```

2. **Navigate Through Pages** (Spend 2-3 minutes):
   - ✅ Open Dashboard
   - ✅ Click Analytics
   - ✅ Go to Live Chat
   - ✅ Open Settings
   - ✅ View FAQs
   - ✅ Check Billing

3. **Perform Actions**:
   - ✅ Create a FAQ
   - ✅ Change a setting
   - ✅ View analytics chart
   - ✅ Click between tabs

---

### Step 3: Wait for Automated Check

After interaction:
- ⏱️ **Wait 2-4 hours** for automated check
- 🔄 Check runs **every 2 hours**
- ✅ Should pass after successful interaction

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue 1: "App not loading in admin"

**Check:**
```bash
# Verify app is running
curl https://shopchat-new.indigenservices.com/health

# Should return: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
```

**Fix:**
- Ensure server is running
- Check PM2 status: `pm2 status shopchat-new`
- Restart if needed: `pm2 restart shopchat-new`

---

### Issue 2: "Permission denied" or OAuth errors

**Fix:**
1. Uninstall app from store
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Reinstall app
4. Grant all permissions

---

### Issue 3: "Embedded app blocked by browser"

**Check:**
- Disable ad blockers
- Allow cookies and popups
- Use Chrome or Firefox (not Safari in private mode)

**Fix:**
```
Chrome Settings → Privacy → Cookies
→ Allow third-party cookies for shopify.com
```

### Issue 4: Still showing "Auto-checked every 2 hours"

This is **NORMAL**! It means:
- ✅ Your app code is correct
- ⏱️ Waiting for you to interact with the app
- 🔄 Will auto-check after you use it

**What to do:**
1. Install app on dev store
2. Use it for 2-3 minutes
3. Wait 2-4 hours for check
4. Status will update automatically

## 📋 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before waiting for automated check:

### App Installation:

- [ ] No installation errors
- [ ] Permissions granted

### App Usage:
- [ ] Accessed app from Shopify admin
- [ ] Navigated to at least 3 pages
- [ ] Performed at least 1 action (create FAQ, change setting, etc.)

## 🧪 TEST YOUR APP BRIDGE SETUP

### Test 1: Check App Bridge in Console

1. Open your app in Shopify admin
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Type:
```javascript
window.shopify.environment
```

**Should see:**
```javascript
{
  embedded: true,
  mobile: false,
  unsupportedBrowser: false
}
```

---

### Test 2: Check Session Tokens

1. Open Network tab in browser
2. Navigate in your app
3. Look at any API request
4. Check headers for:
```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

If you see this, session tokens are working! ✅

---

## 🎓 UNDERSTANDING THE CHECK

### What Shopify Checks:

1. **App Bridge loaded from CDN** ✅ (Your app does this)
   ```javascript
   // In app.tsx
   <AppProvider isEmbeddedApp apiKey={apiKey}>
   ```

2. **Session tokens used** ✅ (Your app does this)
   ```typescript
   // In shopify.server.ts
   await authenticate.admin(request);
   ```

3. **App used on dev store** ⏱️ (You need to do this)
   - Install app
   - Interact with it
   - Generate session data

---

## 📊 EXPECTED TIMELINE

```
Hour 0: Install app on dev store
Hour 0: Interact with app (2-3 minutes)
Hour 2: First automated check runs
Hour 4: Second check runs (usually passes here)
Hour 6: Third check (backup)
```

**Most apps pass within 4 hours of first interaction**

---

## ✅ CONFIRMATION
